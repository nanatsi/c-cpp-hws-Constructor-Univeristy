In file -> testcritter.cpp

After commenting out 'using namespace std;' such error messages occured that:

"string was not declared in this scope" after commenting it out in "critter.cpp" as well.
"cout was not declared in this scope"
"cin was not declared in this scope"
"endl was not declared in this scope"
"name was not declared in this scope"
"getline wasn't declared in this scope"


F.E "cout was not declared in this scope"
meaning that, without "using namespace std" cout object which refers to 
the standart output in cpp is included in the std namespace similarly to cin, endl and string.
thus, since the compiler couldn't recognize the cin, endl and cout objects in the given 
code due to improper qualification, it lead us to a scope-reated error.

name and getline aren't recognized because the cin object which is 
used to input the 'name', is not decleared in current scope and also because of its inability to access the string type.

getline couldn't be called because its arguments cin and name both are unrecognized.

alternative is to write 'std::' in front of cin, cout, string, getline, string and endl.
and for string recognition, header-#include <string>.

after removing -> Critter ::

the compiler expects print function as a part of class critter:: and when it's not written the compiler cannot identify print method and can't really
access its properties. removing Critter :: makes the function looks like as if it's in global scope which results in a scope-related error.

the alternative solution is to write Critter ::, name of the class to implement the funcion included in the previous file correctly.
